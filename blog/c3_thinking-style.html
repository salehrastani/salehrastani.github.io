There are deadlines that I need to abide by. If the material nad challenges are not done by the deadline Ill have to face the consequences. I have obviously paid a significant amount of money and only have a few months to make or break, so Im going to make it.</p>

Whether it is a pairing session with a peer or a guided pairing session an instructor the only thing that matters is to try and learn. It truly does not matter what you previously knew, what you might remember and how quick you pick up things.
