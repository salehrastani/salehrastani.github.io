Version Control, Git and Github

11/02/14

Throughout a coding project there are tons of changes and developments that take in every step of the way. Some are to add features and layers, others are to return to an earlier position. But no matter what kind of edit is necessary the changes that take place are most probably more than one can record. Version control is what keeps track of those changes. Now this could be code or any other file, like excel spreadsheets, word docs and so much more. It allows the coder to communicate with others through his/her code, giving them the ability to change and alter any part of the code without effecting the specific code their fellow coder has accomplished on the same project.

There are many version control programs out there such as CVS or Subversion, however one of the more famous ones is Git. Git is a version control that recognizes the slightest alteration in one’s code. It instantly remembers the path to those changes until the coder decides to keep and apply those changes. When the changes are applied it records the time, executer and snapshot version of the code when it is first saved (committed). The main benefit is that the coders can look back and forth in their process of enhancing the code and return to any version they desire.

In addition to Git, a complimentary web app named Github has been built that provides remote repositories for projects that take place between several coders. The Git platform on one’s local computer can project the changes to the remote platform on the web where it can be seen by different and all contributors of the project. One of the neatest things Github does is that if one version of code is different from another in such a way that the two cannot compliment and therefore, merge with each other, Github will prompt a merge conflict and show the two options and ask to choose one or the other.

In my time as a coder I have personally benefited tremendously from using the remote Github plateform. One of the first things I did trying to learn Git was that I accidentally deleted a decent chunk of my files using the git-clear command. Luckily I had pushed my code and its changes to Github where they resided freely in the sky.
