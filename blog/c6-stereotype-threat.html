                I wish I could say that I have never felt a stereotype threat my whole life. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Growing up in a Iranian family that gave enormous weight to academic acheivement and degrees I was always compeled to struggle to become an attorney or doctor. I knew that I didnt want to be a doctor cause it was simply too much, so I shot for law school and went down the same path most graduates from college take when they aren't sure what to do.<br>
