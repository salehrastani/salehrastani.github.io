                  When I was younger I had a friend that would constantly judge me based on what he thought was right and correct. His beliefs and points of judgement were unacceptable from my perspective. I was always under his scrutiny, while, in fact, he would do outrageous things that made everybody around him question him and angry, but he wouldn't care the least bit. To him it was obvious that he was right and what he did the best thing to do. His confidence was through the roof.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was never myself around him, let alone being like someone that I wanted to be. I was constantly under his judgement and that would not allow me to be anybody other than someone who would simply try to avoid his judgements. This truly made me frustrated. It was unbearable at times so I had to do something about it. After being honest with myself I realized that the only reason that I was angry was that he was more confident in himself than I was, when I was sure that my way of life was, at least in my personal opinion, the better. The fact that he was so free of the emotional side affects of everybody else's judgement made me angry.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of the day I came to the conclusion that I am the one who needs to change, not him because there are so many people like him out there and the only manageable key was me. I was the one who needed to believe in myself rather than expecting others to believe in me.
