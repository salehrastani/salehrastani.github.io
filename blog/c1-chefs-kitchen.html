                A few months ago when I decided to change my career path and jump into a coding boot camp I was given the impression that I will be fire hosed with a ton of material that I have not heard before. In effect, I thought the environment would be extremely intense. I had thoroughly researched all of the different boot camps, including there requirements and stats. The stats were truly promising but it sounded that they weren’t practical unless their students were at the camps for long dreadful hours almost competing with each other. This seemed to be true about most boot camps until I was interviewed at Devbootcamp.

                Doing research about Devbootcamp didn’t alter my initial impression to coding boot camps, since every boot camp advertises themselves as collective and comprehensive programs that require no prior knowledge of coding and claim that they provide the mind, soul and body with exercise. I was surprised by the interview that I had for the coding and cultural challenge. Prior to signing up for Devbootcamp I applied for another boot camp that I thought might be a good fit for me and after going through three rigorous interviews not a single minute did we the interviewer stop to ask about who I was and what made me want to code. That was the first thing I noticed at Devbootcamp.

                The interviewer asked me a few questions and allowed me to explain why I had decided to take this route to be a coder. He asked about my background in general and in coding. He asked about my knowledge about Devbootcamp and what it exactly offered. The last thing we reviewed was the coding challenge. This was the first sign that I had found the right place. After the coding challenge I had a chance to ask a few questions, one of which was why Devbootcamp had not advertised their boot camp with the percentage of graduates that had found jobs and the amount of money they were making. Besides learning that when you are the first and most experienced coding boot camp out there you confident enough in your program to refrain from shouting out the average first-year salaries of your graduates the interviewer told me that Devbootcamp tries to avoid boots that are **merely** participating in the boot camp for the money even though the money is definitely there. He said the program invites and insists on people who are passionate about this process and love to be in this journey.

                Once I was accepted in the program I realized that almost 60 percent of my pre-phaze 0 prep-work was cultural and emotional-related. One of the focal points of both pre-phaze 0 pre-work and the interview material was the emotional intelligence piece from Karim Bishay, the head of admissions at Devbootcamp.

                On top of all that I said, another reason for seeing Devbootcamp as a cultural and technical milestone is the fact that we are required to write and update two blogs:  technical and cultural.

                Personally, this was the type of coding boot camp that I was looking for. A boot camp, which is definitely a boot camp when it comes to learning code but a boot camp that has instructors, an environment and inevitably, boots that are immersed in the idea that in order to be able to get through this journey with our head’s held high we must create an honestly well-rounded and comprehensive system that will excel both technically and culturally.
